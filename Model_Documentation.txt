* How to generate paths
 First, I referred to "Project Walkthrough and Q&A, coded basis of path generation.
 The Outline of gerating paths is below.

  1.refer to sensor fusion result
  2.make decision(go straight or turn left/right)
  3.coordinate transformation(from global to local)
  4.spline interpolation
  5.coordinate transformation(from local to global)

 Next, I go into detail of making decision, line number #281 to #380 of main.cpp.
 I coded based on the rule based approach.

 First, I check the distance of car that is in front of my car.
 If the distance is small, my car should decelerate or turn left/right.
 So, relating flags go true.

 Furthermore, I check the feasibility of turning left/right by checking the car of next lanes.
 And, calculate turning left cost and turning right cost to decide turning direction.

 After checking all cars in sensor fusions, I decided my car should do next
 based on the above flags and costs.
